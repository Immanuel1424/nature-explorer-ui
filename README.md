# Facility Management UI Deployment

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu Server
- Node.js (LTS)
- Nginx
- PM2

## Setup Instructions

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
node --version
npm --version
sudo apt install nginx -y
````

## Clone the Repository

```bash
cd /var/www/
sudo git clone https://github.com/Immanuel1424/nature-explorer-ui.git
sudo mv nature-explorer-ui/ facility-management
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu facility-management/
cd facility-management/
```

## Update PM2 Ecosystem Config

```bash
mv ecosystem.config.js ecosystem.config.cjs
vim ecosystem.config.cjs
```

Update the following fields:

```js
args: 'serve -s dist -l 3000',  //change build to dist
cwd: '/var/www/facility-management', //update the project path

// Update the log path 
error_file: '/var/log/facility-management/logs/err.log',
out_file: '/var/log/facility-management/logs/out.log',
log_file: '/var/log/facility-management/logs/combined.log',
```

## Create Log Directory

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/facility-management/logs
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /var/log/facility-management/logs
```

## Update `package.json`

Set the preview command:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "vite preview --port 3000"
}
```

## Update `<BrowserRouter>`

In `src/App.tsx`, set the base path:

```tsx
<BrowserRouter basename="/facman">
```

## Update `vite.config.ts`

```ts
export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  base: "/facman/",
  server: {
    host: "::",
    port: 8080,
  }
}))
```

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install -g serve
npm install
npm install -g pm2
```

---

Now your React frontend is ready for deployment under `/facman` path.

## üöÄ Deployment

### AWS EC2 Deployment with Bitbucket Pipelines

This project includes automated deployment to AWS EC2 using Bitbucket Pipelines and AWS SSM.

#### Required Bitbucket Variables

Set up the following environment variables in your Bitbucket repository settings:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Your AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Your AWS secret key
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region (e.g., us-east-1)
- `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` - Your EC2 instance ID

#### EC2 Instance Setup

Your Ubuntu-based EC2 instance should have:
1. **Node.js 18+** and npm installed
2. **PM2** installed globally: `npm install -g pm2`
3. **AWS CLI** configured for SSM access
4. **SSM Agent** installed and running
5. **Security groups** allowing HTTP traffic on port 3000
6. **IAM role** with SSM permissions attached to the instance

#### Deployment Process

The Bitbucket Pipeline automatically:
1. Installs dependencies and runs lint checks
2. Builds the React application (`npm run build`)
3. Creates a compressed tarball of the build directory
4. Uploads artifacts to S3
5. Uses AWS SSM to send deployment commands to EC2
6. Downloads and extracts the new build
7. Restarts the application using PM2 as `facility-frontend`

#### Manual Deployment

For manual deployment on your EC2 instance:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd facility-management-system
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start with PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save
pm2 startup

# Check status
pm2 status
```

#### AWS SSM Deployment Command Example

For manual deployment via AWS CLI:

```bash
# Deploy specific build tarball
aws ssm send-command \
  --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 \
  --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" \
  --comment "Deploy Facility Management System" \
  --parameters 'commands=[
    "cd /opt/facility-management",
    "pm2 stop facility-frontend || echo \"App not running\"",
    "sudo rm -rf backup/ && sudo mkdir -p backup/",
    "sudo mv build/ backup/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"No previous build\"",
    "aws s3 cp s3://your-bucket/builds/facility-management-123.tar.gz ./",
    "sudo tar -xzf facility-management-123.tar.gz",
    "sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu build/",
    "pm2 start ecosystem.config.js || pm2 restart facility-frontend",
    "pm2 save",
    "pm2 status"
  ]' \
  --region us-east-1
```
